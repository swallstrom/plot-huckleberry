# plot-huckleberry
Plot data on sleep etc from the Huckleberry app

Data is in a csv file with column names:
Type,Start,End,Duration,Start Condition,Start Location,End Condition,Notes

Type includes things like Sleep, Feed, Pump, Solids, Diaper, Meds, Growth. The column names are clearly intended for 'sleep' first, and repurposed for the other types of data later.
